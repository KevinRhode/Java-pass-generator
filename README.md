To create a small javascript program to help me randomly select a password for security. Not involing my tendentices should help with people not being able to guess it. I build this program to incorporate javascript into a webpage containing html and Css in a simple example. Its solves my indecisiveness of chooseing password to use with accounts. I learned querySelector in java, with selecting an ID.
